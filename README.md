# survis
This is a demo of SurVis, which is a zoonotic disease reporting app that allows users to submit reports electronically and keep up with the status of their report through tracking. In this demo, you start out at the home page and can click anywhere to move to the next page, which is the beginning of the form. You can click through and type in the fields of the form. You can click the back and next buttons at the bottom of the page to mvoe between pages of the form. At the end of the form, you can see a summary of what you selected. What we show in the demo for the confirmation page is static but realistically it should change based on what you input. Once you click submit, it will bring you to the "Thank You" page and then you can see your new case on the home page.
